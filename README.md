## Overview
Date Assistance Tool is a Python project designed to help with date-related operations. This tool provides various functionalities to manipulate and format dates efficiently.
Mostly related to share a valid calendar-based invite for tools that doesn't have any similar tool such as Whastapp, Telegram, Discord, etc.

## Features

- Date calculations
- Date parsing

## Usage
- Git clone the repo to destined directory.
- Optional, I'd rather use python virtual environment.

- run the script:
```python
python main.py
```
